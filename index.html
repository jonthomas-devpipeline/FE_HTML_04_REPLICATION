          <hr />
          <p>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</p>
          <p>
            Computer programming is the process of performing a particular
            computation (or more generally, accomplishing a specific computing
            result), usually by designing and building an executable computer
            program. Programming involves tasks such as analysis, generating
            algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption,
            and the implementation of algorithms (usually in a chosen
            programming language, commonly referred to as coding).<sup
              >[<a href="#">1</a>]</sup
            ><sup>[<a href="#">2</a>]</sup> The source code of a program is
            written in one or more languages that are intelligible to
            programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by
            the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a
            sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a
            task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer,
            often for solving a given problem. Proficient programming thus
            usually requires expertise in several different subjects, including
            knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and
            formal logic. <br /><br />
            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include testing,
            debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems,
            and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of
            computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming
            process, but often the term software development is used for this
            larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding
            reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering
            combines engineering techniques with software development practices.
            Reverse engineering is a related process used by designers,
            analysts, and programmers to understand an existing program and
            re-implement its function.<sup>[<a href="#">3</a>]</sup>

            Programmable devices have existed for centuries. As early as the 9th
            century, a programmable music sequencer was invented by the Persian
            Banu Musa brothers, who described an automated mechanical flute
            player in the Book of Ingenious Devices.[4][5] In 1206, the Arab
            engineer Al-Jazari invented a programmable drum machine where a
            musical mechanical automaton could be made to play different rhythms
            and drum patterns, via pegs and cams.[6][7] In 1801, the Jacquard
            loom could produce entirely different weaves by changing the
            "program" – a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them.
            <br /><br />
            Code-breaking algorithms have also existed for centuries. In the 9th
            century, the Arab mathematician Al-Kindi described a cryptographic
            algorithm for deciphering encrypted code, in A Manuscript on
            Deciphering Cryptographic Messages. He gave the first description of
            cryptanalysis by frequency analysis, the earliest code-breaking
            algorithm.[8]
            <br /><br />
            The first computer program is generally dated to 1843, when
            mathematician Ada Lovelace published an algorithm to calculate a
            sequence of Bernoulli numbers, intended to be carried out by Charles
            Babbage's Analytical Engine.[9]
            <br /><br />
            Data and instructions were once stored on external punched cards,
            which were kept in order and arranged in program decks. In the 1880s
            Herman Hollerith invented the concept of storing data in
            machine-readable form.[10] Later a control panel (plug board) added
            to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to be programmed for
            different jobs, and by the late 1940s, unit record equipment such as
            the IBM 602 and IBM 604, were programmed by control panels in a
            similar way, as were the first electronic computers. However, with
            the concept of the stored-program computer introduced in 1949, both
            programs and data were stored and manipulated in the same way in
            computer memory.[11]

                  paper included the first algorithm designed for processing by
                  an Analytical Engine. She is often recognized as history's
                  first computer programmer.
